            The overall HTML structure of the website follows conventions usually used in creating websites. Starting
            with <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> to inform the browser this is an HTML file.
            Next, the <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;html&gt;</span> with the <span class="
            html-tag-text">&lt;head&gt;</span> and <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;body&gt;</span> tags making up the
            skeleton of the website. The <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;head&gt;</span> section contains information
            for the document through defining
            rules the file follows such as the title tag which is what appears on the browser's tab and <span
                class="html-tag-text">&lt;meta&gt;</span> tags which specifies the character set, provides a description
            for the site. The <span class="html-tag-text">
                &lt;head&gt;</span> tag also imports information and assets from other sources to be used by the HTML
            file. This is done via the various <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;link&gt;</span> and <span
                class="html-tag-text">&lt;script&gt;</span> tags which provide links to the sources of assets the site
            uses or scripts that the site will execute. The <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;body&gt;</span> of the
            website will be explained in depth in the next section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;header&gt;</span> is nowhere to be found, instead the <span class="
            html-tag-text">&lt;div class="headerSearchResult"&gt;</span> and the <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div
                id="logoContainer"&gt;</span> can be found, featuring the logo and the search button respectively. The
            footer isn’t stored in a <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;footer&gt;</span> element but a <span
                class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="footerSection"&gt;</span>,
            similar to the missing <span class="
            html-tag-text">&lt;header&gt;</span>. The footerSection starts off with a spacer to separate the section
            above it from the footer. Next is a <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div&gt;</span> for feedback which is
            currently hidden. Below that
            is a <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div
                class="hueBlock"&gt;</span> used as a spacer to visually differentiate the space above with the <span
                class="html-tag-text">&lt;div&gt;</span> for "copyright" which contains the copyright information of
            friv.com. Then another <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="hueBlock"&gt;</span> ends the website.
            Lastly, numerous scripts and hidden divs are placed at the bottom of the file. Overall the HTML structure
            mostly follows conventions such as following the basic HTML skeleton, proper nesting, and correct
            indentation, the
            website could improve with better use of semantic HTML elements. The inclusion of a proper
            <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;header&gt;</span> and <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;footer&gt;</span>
            element would make the website more organized, improving structure and readability.

        <p>
            As for the main content of the website, the Games display, it is entirely stored within <span
                class="html-tag-text">&lt;main id="gamesBlock"&gt;</span>. Within that section of the website are 296
            versions of <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="gameThumbContainer"&gt;</span> which are used to
            display the main content of the website, friv.com. This allows the user to select which game they would like
            to select and play. This is done through the elements contained in <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div
                class="gameThumbContainer"&gt;</span>,
            which are: <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="gameThumbShine"&gt;</span> containing a shine style
            element for the game thumbnail; an <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;img&gt;</span> element of the game's
            thumbnail within an <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;a&gt;</span> anchor link to direct the user to the game;
            and <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="gameTitle"&gt;</span> which contains the game's title.
            Overall, this is an efficient way of showcasing the games the website has to offer, allowing
            style customizability options that are convenient to use and quick to change.

                <hr>
                <p>It is visually appealing as it showcases all of the available games that they offer. However, with
                    regards to consistency, some of the games are placed far off the edges of the webpage making it a
                    bit difficult to navigate. The website,
                    given its old styles, has very miniature icons which makes it a bad practice in standard
                    human-computer interaction. It is functional however some of the buttons are difficult to access due
                    to the not effective css styling they have
                    for the games. Some games are difficult to click due to being pushed at the edges of the webpage.
                    Moreover, the website is very cluttered and has an overwhelming design due to the number of icons
                    and color choice, making it a difficult
                    experience to navigate.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>The images displayed on the website, particularly the games, are accompanied by alt attributes that
                    state the game's name. This allows screen reader technologies to read and guide people with visual
                    disabilities in navigating the website. However, this feature doesn't extend to the actual game
                    itself. The website is quite challenging for those with visual problems as screen readers won't be
                    able to read or interpret much from the content displayed on this website as it relies on dynamic
                    content, graphics, and interactivity, unlike text-oriented websites like Reddit.
                </p>
                <p>Moreover, a keyboard navigation feature is available on the Friv website. The tab keys can be used to
                    go through the buttons inside the site and select it using the enter button. However, the games
                    inside may not be accessible with the keyboard alone as some games may require mouse input.

                <p>With regards to its accessibility in terms of the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), as
                    aforementioned, the website does offer alternative texts to the game images that state the name of
                    the game, making the website perceivable in this aspect. However, the website doesn't provide all of
                    its functionalities via the keyboard as it still involves a lot of mouse input, making this a flaw
                    in the operable aspect of the website. In addition, Friv's web interface is still understandable; it
                    effectively utilizes high contrast background color that allows the images for the games to stand
                    out, uses appropriate font sizes and styles that make them readable, and ensures that its web pages
                    behave predictably, making it intuitive for its users. </p>
