            The overall HTML structure of the website follows conventions usually used in creating websites. 
            Starting with <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> to inform the browser this 
            is an HTML file. Next, the <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;html&gt;</span> with the <span class="
            html-tag-text">&lt;head&gt;</span> and <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;body&gt;</span> tags making 
            up the skeleton of the website. The <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;head&gt;</span> section contains 
            information for the document through defining rules the file follows such as the title tag which is 
            what appears on the browser's tab and <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;meta&gt;</span> tags which 
            specifies the character set, provides a description for the site. The <span class="html-tag-text">
            &lt;head&gt;</span> tag also imports information and assets from other sources to be used by the HTML 
            file. This is done via the various <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;link&gt;</span> and <span class=
            "html-tag-text">&lt;script&gt;</span> tags which provide links to the sources of assets the site uses
            or scripts that the site will execute. The <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;body&gt;</span> of the 
            website will be explained in depth in the next section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;header&gt;</span> is nowhere to be found, instead the <span class="
            html-tag-text">&lt;div class="headerSearchResult"&gt;</span> and the <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div 
            id="logoContainer"&gt;</span> can be found, featuring the logo and the search button respectively.
            The footer isn’t stored in a <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;footer&gt;</span> element but a <span 
            class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="footerSection"&gt;</span>, similar to the missing <span class="
            html-tag-text">&lt;header&gt;</span>. The footerSection starts off with a spacer to 
            separate the section above it from the footer. Next is a <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div&gt;</span> 
            for feedback which is currently hidden. Below that is a <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div 
            class="hueBlock"&gt;</span> used as a spacer to visually differentiate the space above with the <span 
            class="html-tag-text">&lt;div&gt;</span> for "copyright" which contains the copyright information of 
            friv.com. Then another <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="hueBlock"&gt;</span> ends the 
            website. Lastly, numerous scripts and hidden divs are placed at the bottom of the file. Overall the HTML
            structure mostly follows conventions such as following the basic HTML skeleton, proper nesting, and correct
            indentation, the website could improve with better use of semantic HTML elements. The inclusion of a proper
            <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;header&gt;</span> and <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;footer&gt;</span> 
            element would make the website more organized, improving structure and readability.

        </div>
        <p>
            As for the main content of the website, the Games display, it is entirely stored within <span 
            class="html-tag-text">&lt;main id="gamesBlock"&gt;</span>. Within that section of the website 
            are 296 versions of <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="gameThumbContainer"&gt;</span> 
            which are used to display the main content of the website, friv.com. This allows the user to 
            select which game they would like to select and play. This is done through the elements contained 
            in <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="gameThumbContainer"&gt;</span>, which are: <span 
            class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="gameThumbShine"&gt;</span> containing a shine style element 
            for the game thumbnail; an <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;img&gt;</span> element of the game's 
            thumbnail within an <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;a&gt;</span> anchor link to direct the user 
            to the game; and <span class="html-tag-text">&lt;div class="gameTitle"&gt;</span> which contains 
            the game's title. Overall, this is an efficient way of showcasing the games the website has to
            offer, allowing style customizability options that are convenient to use and quick to change.
